# creeptifica2

[creeptifica2](https://github.com/Akuma/creeptifica) is an adaptation of the 
amazingly simplistic yet stunning [creep](https://github.com/romeovs/creep) 
and [scientifica](https://github.com/NerdyPepper/scientifica). Like the two 
formerly mentioned projects, most characters are only 4px wide, which greatly 
accommodates low dpi displays.

## Installation

Installing fonts are different for every system. Reference your system's manual
for details on installing TrueType fonts.
